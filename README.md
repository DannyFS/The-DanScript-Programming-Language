# The-DanScript-Programming-Language
A toy interpreter I am making as a Freshman In College. Entirely written in c++ to learn how tokenization, parsing, ast, and execution engines work. Everything here is probably terribly spaghetti.

Goal:
- To have a working interpreter that uses a custom built library system that includes a standard library system
- Create a 2D game running pure DanScript (except for the header files from the internet)
